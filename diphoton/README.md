# Mini Tree with diphoton information

To load root better use the same version I used to create the tree.

```source /cvmfs/sw.hsf.org/key4hep/setup.sh -r 2024-10-03```

The trees have been created with the script miniTreeForAnneMarie.py. 

The source (bigger) edm4hep roottrees are at the CIEMAT cluster, I can move part of it to CERN

A sample tree to start with with only 10000 events is in 

```miniTree.root```
